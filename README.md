### ***OVERVIEW:***

A program that implements the Euclidean algorithm and outputs to the user a table in which the process for attaining the GCD(a, b) is shown. Inspired by my discrete math class. A demonstration of my teaching myself Python. 

### ***INCLUDED FILES:***

 * EuclideanAlg.py - main file
 * README - this file


### ***COMPILING AND RUNNING:***



### ***PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:***

 

### ***TESTING:***
Testing was done simply by running, tinkering, and then running again. No test class was created for this project.


### ***DISCUSSION:***
This program could be optimized by making it so the spreadsheet lines are symmetrical all the way across regardless of the size difference of a and b.
