### ***OVERVIEW:***

A program that implements the Euclidean algorithm and outputs to the user a table in which the process for attaining the GCD(a, b) is shown. Inspired by my discrete math class. A demonstration of my teaching myself Python. 

### ***INCLUDED FILES:***

 * EuclideanAlg.py - main file
 * README - this file


### ***COMPILING AND RUNNING:***
To run the program in a terminal, navigate to the directory where you have the repository downloaded and type the following command:
$ python3 EuclideanAlg.py

If this does not work, do:
$ python EuclideanAlg.py

Once running, enter 2 non-negative integers and the program will do the rest!
*Note that the '$' character is not actually typed, that's just to symbolize being in the terminal*

### ***PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:***
This program creates a spreadsheet-like representation of the Euclidean algorithm by calculating quotients, remainders, and in turn the GCD.
 

### ***TESTING:***
Testing was done simply by running, tinkering, and then running again. No test class was created for this project.


### ***DISCUSSION:***
This program could be optimized by making it so the spreadsheet lines are symmetrical all the way across regardless of the size difference of a and b.
